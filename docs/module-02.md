## Introduction

> As you watch the following videos, <u>take notes</u>. Whatever examples the teacher gives, pause the video, and copy them down in your own notebook. Work out the problem with him or her so that you can go through the process as well. Remember: learning is active!

### FRIDAY: Now in Pictures!

The first six videos of the YouTube series, "Visual Algebra" lay a strong foundation for understanding how numbers relate to each other. Even though it repeats the explanations above, it uses a different illustration. I encourage you to watch to reinforce the concept.
