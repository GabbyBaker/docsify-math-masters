## THURSDAY: Accelerated Addition {#03-review1}

### Discover Patterns

*Choose one or more of the activities below to explore math principles before diving into the "Develop Skills" section.* 

#### <u>Activity 1</u>

Using the canvas below, fill in the missing parts of the multiplication table. Use Number Tiles or copy the existing tiles.

> Reflect:
>
> - *What patterns do you see in the multiplication table?*
> - *What methods & strategies did you use to create the missing shapes?*
> - *Which shapes are squares and which are rectangles?*



#### <u>Activity 2</u>

Complete this activity: [Multiplication](https://schoolyourself.org/learn/algebra/multiplication)



### Develop Skills

> As you watch the following videos, <u>take notes</u>. Whatever examples the teacher gives, pause the video, and copy them down in your own notebook. Work out the problem with him or her so that you can go through the process as well. Remember: learning is active!

#### Now Your Turn:

Do the following problems **twice**, <u>first</u> with addition, <u>then</u> with multiplication.

1. $$
   372 + 372 = y
   $$

   $$
   372 × 2 = y
   $$

2. $$
   470 + 470 = b
   $$

   $$
   470 × 2 = b
   $$

3. $$
   730 + 730 + 730 = t
   $$

   $$
   730 × 3 = t
   $$

4. What is the cost of 5 chairs if each one costs $23?

5. How much would you pay for 8 calculators if each one costs $238?

6. A sports car costs $28,564. What is the cost of 3 such cars?

## FRIDAY: How to Multiply Negative Numbers {#03-review2}

### Discover Patterns

One way to visualize operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) is to use the **Bucket of Zero.**



Now that you've seen how it works, try it yourself!

### Dig for Truth

We will revisit this topic in Step 10 a few weeks from now, but you can dig deeper now if you want to.



> I know how to simply expressions and make polynomials like this:
> $$
> a^2 + 4b
> $$
> I also know how to use the distributive property on an expression like this:
> $$
> 3(a^2+4b) = 3a^2+12b
> $$
> But what if I am asked to multiply a polynomial by *another* polynomial, like this:
> $$
> (a + 4)(a + 2) = ?
> $$
